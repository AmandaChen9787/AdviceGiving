Imagine that your team lacks anyone skilled in data analysis, and your boss tasks you with analyzing visitor behavior on the company's website to the best of your ability. A week later, you ask a colleague from a different team to provide feedback on your work so that you can improve it before presenting it to your boss.


Upon reviewing your analysis, your colleague says, ""This makes no sense. Have you ever worked with data before?""

Between now and the follow-up survey, we will invite other participants who get to see your score on the test. They will be asked to give you advice on which of the two groups to compete against.

We would like to ask you about your group preference for the competition, but please note that this initial choice is simply to gain insight into your preferences. By default, we have pre-selected the High Performer Group, but you may change your selection if you wish.
